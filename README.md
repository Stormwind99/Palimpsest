# Palimpsest

Erase Maps and Books for reuse by rubbing with Redstone Dust with this Minecraft mod.

Historically, a palimpsest is "a manuscript page, either from a scroll or a book, from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document" \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest)\].   Materials for writing were expensive to create, so were reused when possible.

This mod contains shapeless recipes that, when one of the following items is rubbed (aka crafted) with Redstone Dust, will produce a blank version of the item (consuming the Redstone Dust in the process):

1. Filled Map
1. Written Book
1. Writable Book
1. Enchanted Book
 
## Example uses

1. Collected some low power Enchanted Books you don't need?  Recycle them into Books to use for new enchantments.
1. Accidentally create multiple Filled Maps of the same area?  Erase the the duplicate Filled Maps to use again.
1. Use [Bibliocraft](http://www.bibliocraftmod.com/)'s Atlas with Filled Maps but accidentally create a Filled Map of the wrong scale level?  Erase it!
