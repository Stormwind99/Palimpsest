# Palimpsest
Minecraft mod: Erase Maps and Books for reuse by rubbing with Redstone Dust.

Historically, a palimpsest is "a manuscript page, either from a scroll or a book, from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document" \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimpsest)\].   Materials for writing were expensive to create, so were reused when possible.

This mod contains shapeless recipes that, when one of the following items is rubbed (aka crafted) with Redstone Dust, will produce a blank version of the item (consuming the Redstone Dust in the process):

1. Filled Map
2. Written Book
3. Writable Book
4. Enchanted Book
